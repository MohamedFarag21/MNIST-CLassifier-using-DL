# MNIST-CLassifier-using-DL
MNIST Classification becomes one of the simplest and basic tasks in order to test new Deep learning models, Using CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) showed us that it can be to perform so well on such a task, the data consists of 60K samples, with gray scale, each image is (28,28,1) ~ (H, W, C)
